# FlightSim
A spaceflight sim built with the Irrlicht engine and Bullet physics.

Libraries being used:

-Bullet3 physics

-Irrlicht 1.8.4

-irrKlang

Includes basic AI with state handling, an Entity-Component-System setup to handle data and some neat systems to handle events. More stuff being added on a daily basis. 
The current build is technically complete; that is you can boot it up and start shooting people in space. Current work is going to be adding some extra weapons, ships, augmentations, and more. 
The end goal is some randomized missions with randomized ships and different scenarios for each, with the ability to unlock weapons and other ships as you progress.

In order to install, simply pull the repository and make sure you can pull a Bullet physics install as well. Currently, the binaries are included for the other libs, but that may not always be the case. 
The project is compiled using Visual Studio 2019.
